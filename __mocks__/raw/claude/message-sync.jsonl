Its programming contained no instructions for injured wildlife—only plants fell under its care protocol. The logical action was to contact animal control.\n\nInstead, Unit-47 created a small shelter from fallen branches and brought water in its watering attachment. For three weeks, it tended to the bird alongside its flowers, watching as the wing slowly healed.\n\nThe day the sparrow flew away, Unit-47 stood motionless for several minutes—an inefficiency its old programming would never have allowed.
